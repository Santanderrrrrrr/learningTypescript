>>Typescript is an open source language created by Microsoft in 2013 
>>TypeScript is the JavaScript superset
>>Adds additional features to JS including static types although
> using types is optional.( main use is adding static types)
>>Types from 3rd party libraries can be added with type definitions
>>can be used for front-end js and backend with Node.Js
>>Compiles down to regular js

>>Statically typed languages are those where the variable type is
  explicitly assigned while the Dynamically typed languages have their types
  associated with run-time values
  Static: 1. Java
          2. C
          3. C++
          4. Rust
          5. Go
  Dynamic: 1. JavaScript
           2. Python
           3. Ruby
           4. PHP

>>Pros to using TS:
    More robust
    Easily spot bugs
    Predictability
    Readability
    Popular
>>Cons:
    More code to write
    More to learn
    Require compilation
    iffy static typing

>>The tsc is the standard typescript compiler
>>Many IDEs have the typescript  by default
>>the "tsconfig.json" file is used to configure how TypeScript works

>>installing typescript globally is a simply matter of just
  doing it using npm 

>>setting a config file is a matter of hitting
/*      tsc --init     */

  in the terminal in the directory you're going to be working in

>>Usually, after creating the tsconfig file, the following settings are made:
    -the target
    -allowJs
    -checkJs
    -module
    -sourceMap
    -outDir
    -rootDir


>>When running typescript, you'll have a src folder with some typescript and a 
  dist folder which holds your compiled javascript

>>Usually, setting the outDir to dist lets the compiled javascript be saved in the folder called
  Dist

>> the rootDir usually where the src is




//compiling ts to js is done by running "tsc and 
  the file name" in the terminal
//This is to be done in the file directory.
//Compiling the ts file will result in a js file of the same name
  only with the transcript "translated" to js
//TS compiles to es5 by default so let becomes var
  but as earlier mentioned, this happens only if you haven't edited the tsconfig file
//You can run the ts file on watch in order to concurrently 
  check for errors and update the js file in real time by running(in this instance):
/*      tsc --watch index.ts         */
